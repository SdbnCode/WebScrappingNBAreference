# Scrapping Data from NBA Reference  

## Description
This project was created due to the frustration of relying on the data provided by some APIs.
The data provided from APIs would always be limiting in terms of scope (not detailed enough or not enough data in general) or held behind a paywall.
Both of which are extremely frustating.

## Goal
I want to be able to create applications without the any data limitation and so I must learn how to web scrape.

Learning outcomes: 
1. Learn how to use python to web scrape
2. Learn how to clean data for use
